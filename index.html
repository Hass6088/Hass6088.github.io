				<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>Hi, My name is Chandler and i'm a college student currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology with a focus on System Security. My dream is to work in digital forensics for an agency, where I can use my skills to help investigate and protect against cyber threats. I'm especially interested in how digital evidence can be used to solve real-world crimes and bring justice to victims.</p>
					
					
					<p>Outside of school, I'm passionate about soccer, photography, and spending time in nature. These hobbies help me stay active and creative. Soccer keeps me disciplined and goal-oriented, while photography allows me to express how I see the world. Whether I am exploring a hiking trail or capturing a sunset with my camera, I always find inspiration in the outdoors.</p>
					

					<p>I grew up in Texas, moved to Florida during the COVID-19 pandemic, and then relocated to North Carolina in 2023. Each move has played a part in shaping who I am today, teaching me how to adapt, stay resilient, and connect with different communities. These experiences have fueled my desire to keep learning and growing, both personally and professionally.</p>
